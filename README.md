## VSD BabySoC Theory


The project details the design of **BabySoC**, a compact, open-source, RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) for educational purposes, featuring a **RVMYTH** processor core, a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** for stable clocking, and a **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** for mixed-signal communication. Built using **Sky130 technology**, BabySoC aims to provide a documented platform for learning digital-analog system design by enabling the DAC to convert digital data into analog signals, facilitating interaction with external devices for output.

Below is a basic understanding document of theoretical concepts of my learnings about the BabySoC.

   ### 📖 Theory – Fundamentals of SoC

A **System on a Chip (SoC)** is a **single integrated circuit (IC)** that combines multiple electronic components, such as processors, memory, input/output ports, and various functional units like GPUs and modems, into one compact chip. SoCs are foundational to modern electronics, notably in smartphones, tablets, and laptops, because their high integration:  

- Reduces device size 📏  
- Decreases power consumption ⚡  
- Optimizes performance by shortening signal paths 🚀  
- Offers significant cost benefits 💰  

### 🛠 What SoC Includes

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**  
   The "brain" of the SoC, responsible for executing instructions and managing tasks for the overall system 🧠

2. **Memory:**  
   Includes on-chip RAM **(Random Access Memory)** for temporary data storage and ROM **(Read-Only Memory)** for permanent system instructions and firmware 💾

3. **Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces:**  
   Allows the SoC to communicate with other devices and components, such as USB, SPI, and I2C 🔌

4. **Power Management Units:**  
   Circuits designed to manage and optimize the power consumption of the entire system, crucial for battery-powered devices 🔋

5. **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):**  
   Optimized for signal processing tasks, such as data collection, processing, and decoding images 🎵📷

6. **Connectivity Modules:**  
   Integrated components for wireless communication, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 🌐
