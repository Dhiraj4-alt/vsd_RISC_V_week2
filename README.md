### 🧠 VSDBabySoC Overview

* BabySoC is a small, open-source System-on-Chip (SoC) built using the RISC-V architecture.

* Designed to test 3 open-source IP cores — CPU, PLL, and DAC — and analyze their analog behavior.

* Built for learning SoC integration of digital and analog blocks.

### ⚙️ Key Components

1. **CPU – RVMYTH**

* 32-bit RISC-V based microprocessor core developed by VSD Corp.

* Implements RV32I instruction set (basic integer instructions).

* Pipeline stages: IF → ID → EX → MEM → WB.

* Receives clock from PLL and communicates externally via SPI interface.

* Output is sent to DAC for analog conversion.

* Runs at 1.8V for low power consumption.

2. **Clock Generator – 8x PLL**

PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) generates a high-frequency clock from a slower reference clock.

Main parts:

* Phase Detector: Compares input and output phases.

* Loop Filter: Removes unwanted noise.

* VCO: Generates clock controlled by input voltage.

* Feedback Divider: Divides frequency by 8 (8x PLL → output = 8× input frequency).


**Purpose:**

* Multiplies clock frequency for high-speed SoC operations.

* Distributes clean, stable clock signals across the chip.

* Reduces jitter and noise for reliable performance.

3. **Output Interface – 10-bit DAC**

* DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) converts digital signals into continuous analog output.

* Acts as a bridge between the digital CPU output and real-world analog devices.

**Key Features:**
