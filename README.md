# 🌎 VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program week 2

Welcome to Week 2 of my VSD RISC V Tapeout Program journey! This week, I'll be exploring the fundamentals of **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design-understanding what an SoC is, its key components like CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnects, and why BabySoC serves as a simplified model for learning these concepts. Alongside theory, I'll dive into hands-on labs with the VSDBabySoC project, using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave to simulate reset, clocking, and dataflow operations, then capture and explain waveforms. By the end of the week, I aim to connect conceptual knowledge with practical experience, building a strong foundation for deeper SoC design learning

## 🧠 Part 1: Theory – Fundamentals of SoC Design

In this section, I explore the conceptual side of SoC design:

* What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

* Key Components: CPU, memory,     peripherals, interconnect.

* Why BabySoC? → A simplified learning model for SoC design.

* Role of Functional Modelling before RTL and physical design stages.

## 🛠️ Part 2: Labs – VSDBabySoC Functional Modelling

This section covers practical implementation using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

🔬 Lab Steps

1. Clone the BabySoC project repo.

2. Compile Verilog modules with iverilog.

3. Simulate and generate .vcd waveform files.

4. Open waveforms in GTKWave and analyze:

Reset operation

Clocking behavior

Dataflow between modules

5. Document observations with logs + screenshots.
