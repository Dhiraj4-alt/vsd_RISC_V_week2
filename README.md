# 🌎 VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program week 2

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in the VSD RISC-V SoC Design Program. The focus is on understanding the fundamentals of System-on-Chip (SoC) design and applying them through hands-on labs using the VSDBabySoC project.

The repo is divided into two main parts:

1. Theory (Conceptual Understanding) – Summarizing SoC design concepts.


2. Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling) – Verilog simulations, waveform analysis, and observations.

## 🧠 Part 1: Theory – Fundamentals of SoC Design

In this section, I explore the conceptual side of SoC design:

What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

Key Components: CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnect.

Why BabySoC? → A simplified learning model for SoC design.

Role of Functional Modelling before RTL and physical design stages.

## 🛠️ Part 2: Labs – VSDBabySoC Functional Modelling

This section covers practical implementation using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.

🔬 Lab Steps

1. Clone the BabySoC project repo.


2. Compile Verilog modules with iverilog.


3. Simulate and generate .vcd waveform files.


4. Open waveforms in GTKWave and analyze:

Reset operation

Clocking behavior

Dataflow between modules



5. Document observations with logs + screenshots.



## 📑 Deliverables

Simulation logs

GTKWave screenshots (with explanations)

Observed BabySoC behavior

## 🎯 Week 2 Learning Outcomes

Gained theoretical understanding of SoC design fundamentals.

Learned how functional modelling acts as a bridge before RTL/physical design.

Successfully simulated VSDBabySoC and verified core operations with GTKWave.
