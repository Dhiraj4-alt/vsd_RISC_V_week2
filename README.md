## VSD BabySoC â€“ Theory

The project details the design of **BabySoC**, a compact, open-source, RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) for educational purposes, featuring a **RVMYTH** processor core, a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** for stable clocking, and a **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** for mixed-signal communication. Built using **Sky130 technology**, BabySoC aims to provide a documented platform for learning digital-analog system design by enabling the DAC to convert digital data into analog signals, facilitating interaction with external devices for output.
Below is a basic understandinng document of theoritical concepts of my learnings about the BabySoC..

### ðŸ“– Theory â€“ Fundamentals of SoC

A **System on a Chip (SoC)** is a **single integrated circuit (IC)** that combines multiple electronic components, such as processors, memory, input/output ports, and various functional units like GPUs and modems, into one compact chip. SoCs are foundational to modern electronics, notably in smartphones, tablets, and laptops, because their high integration reduces device size, decreases power consumption, optimizes performance by shortening signal paths, and offers significant cost benefits compared to traditional, multi-component architectures.  


### What SoC Have Inside

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The "brain" of the SoC, responsible for executing instructions and managing tasks for the overall system

2. **Memory:** Includes on-chip RAM **(Random Access Memory)** for temporary data storage and ROM **(Read-Only Memory)** for permanent system instructions and firmware.

3. **Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces:** Allows the SoC to communicate with other devices and components, such as USB, SPI, and I2C 

4. **Power Management Units:** Circuits designed to manage and optimize the power consumption of the entire system, crucial for battery-powered devices 

5. **Digital Signal Processor (DSP):** Optimized for signal processing tasks, such as data collection, processing, and decoding images 
6. **Connectivity Modules:** Integrated components for wireless communication, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetoot
Benefits of SoCs

### SoC are Cool because

1. **Miniaturization:** Enables smaller and more portable electronic devices. 

2. **Performance:** Reduced distances between components on a single chip improve signal integrity and speed. 

3. **Power Efficiency:** Highly integrated designs often lead to lower overall power consumption. 

4. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Mass production of a single complex chip can be more economical than manufacturing and assembling many separate chips. 

5. **Customization:** SoCs can be tailored with specific components to meet the unique requirements of different electronic systems. 

## Where all can u find SoC

SoCs are used in a vast array of devices: 

1. **Mobile Devices:** Smartphones and tablets heavily rely on SoCs for their compact design and diverse functionality.
